  Implementation guardrails for rebuilding the Peloton scraper as a modular, testable app that updates ytdl-sub configs.

  - "tests/**/*.py"
  - "Dockerfile"
  - "docker-compose.yml"
  - "pytest.ini"
  - "requirements.txt"

rules: |
  - Architecture
    - **IMPLEMENTED**: Flattened package structure under `src/` with subpackages: `config`, `core`, `io`.
    - **IMPLEMENTED**: `main.py` as clean entry point delegating to `core/application.py` for business logic.
    - **IMPLEMENTED**: `config/` handles CLI parsing and configuration loading separately from business logic.
    - **IMPLEMENTED**: `core` (application, logging, models), `io` (episode parsing, file management, directory validation) modules complete.
    - **IMPLEMENTED**: Directory structure validation and repair system for handling corrupted 50/50 patterns.
    - Keep business logic out of the main entry point; compose dependencies explicitly.
    - Use pure functions and immutable dataclasses where feasible.
    - No module should import from `tests`.

  - Documentation Synchronization (CRITICAL)
    - **ALWAYS UPDATE DOCUMENTATION** when making code changes that affect:
      - Package structure or file organization
      - CLI commands, arguments, or usage examples
      - Configuration options or environment variables
      - Major features or functionality
      - Testing procedures or coverage requirements
    - **MANDATORY UPDATES** for any architectural changes:
      - Update `.cursor/project-definition.mdc` to reflect current implementation status
      - Update `README.md` project structure, usage examples, and feature descriptions
      - Update any affected documentation in `docs/` folder
    - **NO CODE CHANGES WITHOUT DOC UPDATES** - Documentation must be kept current with the codebase.

  - Types and Style
    - Add type hints to all public functions and class methods.
    - Prefer explicit names over abbreviations; avoid 1â€“2 letter variables.
    - Use guard clauses over deep nesting; handle errors early.
    - Replace prints with `logging` and structured messages.

  - Config and I/O
    - **IMPLEMENTED**: `config/config.py` handles multi-source config (env vars, CLI args, YAML files) with precedence.
    - **IMPLEMENTED**: `config/cli_config.py` manages CLI argument parsing separately from configuration loading.
    - **IMPLEMENTED**: `io/file_manager.py` provides unified interface for filesystem and subscription parsing.
    - **IMPLEMENTED**: `io/directory_validator.py` pre-processes directories to fix corrupted structures and episode conflicts.
    - **IMPLEMENTED**: Episode numbering system with filesystem and subscription parsers in `io/` module.
    - **IMPLEMENTED**: Season = duration (minutes), Episode = sequential numbering per activity/instructor.
    - **IMPLEMENTED**: Robust handling of 50/50 directory corruption issues from legacy implementations.
    - Preserve YAML structure and key stability expected by ytdl-sub.

  - Scrapers
    - Define a scraper protocol in `sources/base.py` (interfaces for session lifecycle and scrape output model).
    - Selenium session management belongs in `sources/peloton/session.py` with container-friendly flags.
    - Parsing and page traversal belong in `sources/peloton/scraper.py`. External calls are isolated for mocking.

  - Services
    - `services/subscriptions.py` handles merge/dedupe, duplicate-title suffixing, and activity mapping.
    - `services/git_sync.py` wraps repo clone/pull/commit/push/PR with tokens read from config.

  - Testing (CRITICAL - PROJECT IS TEST-GATED)
    - **ALL CODE CHANGES MUST PASS TESTS** - The CI/CD pipeline will fail if tests don't pass.
    - **NEW FUNCTIONALITY REQUIRES NEW TESTS** - Any new feature, class, or function must include corresponding test coverage.
    - **COVERAGE TARGET: 80%** - Maintain at least 80% test coverage across the codebase.
    - **UPDATE EXISTING TESTS** - When modifying existing code, update the corresponding tests to reflect changes.
    - **RUN TESTS LOCALLY** - Always run `pytest tests/` before committing changes.
    - **IMPLEMENTED**: Comprehensive test suite in `tests/` with `pytest.ini` configuration.
    - **IMPLEMENTED**: `tests/core/` for core functionality, `tests/io/` for episode parsing.
    - **IMPLEMENTED**: Test fixtures, integration tests, and edge case coverage.
    - **IMPLEMENTED**: Helper scripts `scripts/run-tests.sh` and `scripts/run-tests.ps1`.
    - Use `pytest`; keep Selenium and network calls mocked.
    - Mirror package structure in `tests/` and cover core/services thoroughly.
    - Include fixtures for sample media trees and YAML snippets.
    - **TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT** - Consider writing tests first, then implementing functionality.
    - **INTEGRATION TESTS** - Include integration tests for complete workflows (file parsing, episode numbering, etc.).
    - **EDGE CASE TESTING** - Test error conditions, invalid inputs, and boundary cases.

  - Docker/CI
    - **IMPLEMENTED**: Dockerfile with chromium/chromedriver, proper entrypoint, and semantic versioning.
    - **IMPLEMENTED**: Docker Compose configuration for local development.
    - **IMPLEMENTED**: GitHub Actions workflow with test-gated builds (tests must pass before Docker image builds).
    - **IMPLEMENTED**: Helper scripts in `scripts/` for Docker operations and version management.
    - **IMPLEMENTED**: VS Code debug configurations with .env file support.
    - Keep image minimal; use `--no-cache-dir` for pip and remove apt lists.
    - Semantic versioning with 0.1.0 initial version.

  - Security
    - **IMPLEMENTED**: Secure credential handling with .env files (git-ignored) and masked logging.
    - Never log secrets or tokens.
    - Access tokens and credentials only via environment variables.

  - Non-goals for MVP
    - No additional sources beyond Peloton yet; design must allow easy addition later.
    - No E2E browser tests; rely on unit tests with mocks.
