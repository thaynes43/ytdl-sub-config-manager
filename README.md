# ytdl-sub Config Manager

A modular Peloton scraper for ytdl-sub subscriptions. This application periodically scrapes Peloton classes and automatically updates ytdl-sub configuration files to download new content.

## Quick Start

1. **Setup environment**:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Peloton credentials
   ```

2. **Run locally**:
   ```bash
   # Run the full scraping workflow
   python -m src scrape
   
   # Or validate/repair directory structure only
   python -m src validate --media-dir ./media --dry-run
   ```

3. **Run with Docker**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/docker-run.sh build
   ./scripts/docker-run.sh run
   ```

## Features

- **Multi-source configuration**: Environment variables, CLI args, and nested YAML files with precedence

- **Directory validation**: Automated detection and repair of corrupted directory structures
- **Comprehensive testing**: Test-gated development with 80% coverage target
- **Docker support**: Full containerization with helper scripts
- **VS Code integration**: Debug configurations and tasks
- **CI/CD pipeline**: GitHub Actions with test-gated builds and semantic versioning

## Episode Naming Strategy

The application uses a specific naming convention for organizing Peloton classes:

### Season and Episode Structure
- **Season Number**: The workout duration in minutes (e.g., 20, 30, 45)
- **Episode Number**: Sequential numbering starting from 1 for the oldest video in each season
- **Activity Grouping**: Classes are grouped by activity type (Cycling, Yoga, Strength, etc.)
- **Instructor Organization**: Episodes are organized by instructor within each activity

### Directory Structure
```

```

### Episode Number Determination
The application determines the next episode number by checking two sources:

1. **Filesystem Analysis**: Scans existing downloaded files in `MEDIA_DIR`
   - Parses `S{season}E{episode}` patterns from folder names
   - Tracks the highest episode number per season per activity

2. **Subscriptions Analysis**: Parses the ytdl-sub subscriptions YAML
   - Extracts episode numbers from configured downloads
   - Ensures no overlap with pending downloads

3. **Merged Results**: Combines both sources to determine the next available episode number
   - Takes the maximum episode number from either source
   - Increments by 1 for new episodes

## Development

- **Debug in VS Code**: Press F5 after setting up your `.env` file
- **Update version**: `./scripts/update-version.sh 0.2.0`

### Testing ðŸ§ª

The project maintains **84% test coverage** with **153 comprehensive tests**. Testing is **mandatory** - all code changes must pass tests and maintain coverage.

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests (recommended before committing)
python -m pytest tests/

# Run with coverage report
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test modules
python -m pytest tests/core/        # Core functionality tests
python -m pytest tests/config/      # Configuration tests  
python -m pytest tests/io/          # I/O and parsing tests

# Run with coverage enforcement (fails if below 80%)
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-fail-under=80

# Use helper scripts (cross-platform)
./scripts/run-tests.sh              # Unix/Linux/macOS
./scripts/run-tests.ps1             # Windows PowerShell
```

#### Test Organization

- **`tests/core/`** - Application logic, logging, models (98%+ coverage)
- **`tests/config/`** - CLI parsing, configuration loading (98%+ coverage)  
- **`tests/io/`** - File operations, episode parsing, strategies (90%+ coverage)
- **`pytest.ini`** - Pytest configuration with markers and options
- **`tests/conftest.py`** - Shared fixtures and test setup

#### Coverage Requirements

- **Minimum**: 80% overall coverage (enforced by CI/CD)
- **Current**: 84% coverage achieved
- **High-coverage modules** (maintain these levels):
  - `config.py`: 98% | `cli_config.py`: 99% | `application.py`: 96%
  - `main.py`: 97% | `strategy_loader.py`: 100% | `file_manager.py`: 93%

#### Testing Best Practices

- **Before committing**: Always run `python -m pytest tests/`
- **New features**: Must include corresponding test coverage
- **Regression prevention**: Check coverage with `--cov-report=term-missing`
- **Test isolation**: All tests use proper mocking and fixtures
- **CI/CD gating**: Tests must pass before Docker builds or merges
